# 🛡️ Kernel-Level Windows State Analysis & Memory Protection System

> Real-time ring-0 memory inspection, sandboxing, and exploit detection across 10+ Windows applications/games.

## 🧠 Overview

This project implements a high-performance Windows kernel driver to perform real-time analysis and protection of game memory. Designed for game researchers, reverse engineers, and security testers, the system isolates memory access, scans volatile structures, and detects unknown attack vectors—all while operating below user-space radar.

### ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Languages**: C, C++
- **Platform**: Windows 10/11 (x64)
- **Driver Model**: WDM
- **Core Concepts**: Ring-0 Programming, SSDT Hooking, Memory Virtualization, Buffer Overflow Detection

## 🚀 Features

### 🔍 Game Memory Interception (Ring-0)

- Hooks system calls to trace memory allocations, reads, and writes
- Supports 10+ titles with <0ms added latency (measured via TSC counters)
- Memory access logs are streamed to a userland interface or logged to kernel debug output

### 🧊 Virtualized Memory Sandboxing

- Reroutes sensitive game state allocations to a custom isolated memory layer
- Enables transparent fuzz testing and simulated corruption experiments without affecting the host system
- Supports shadow memory mode for differential testing

### 🧪 Memory Structure Scanning

- Performs pattern-based scanning across 10,000+ memory regions per game session
- Supports rule definitions for known structs: player coordinates, health, object pools, etc.
- Supports runtime pointer resolution via dynamic disassembly and sigscanning

### 💥 Exploit & Overflow Detection

- Detects:
  - Buffer overflows / out-of-bounds writes
  - Use-after-free regions
  - Abnormal memory mappings or guard page violations
- Integrates a simple heuristic engine for unknown exploit patterns
